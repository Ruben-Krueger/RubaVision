// Hi Ruben! This is looking great! One suggestion would be for a menu option to choose the location of the circle.
// In the example you sent, the big circle moves around locations, which is fine (and is what I had originally described),
// but during Jamesâ€™ clinical trial, the circle was in a static location (i.e. top left part of his visual field).
// Maybe you could insert a menu option to choose the location of the big circle as like XY coordinates?
// But then if you *do* have the big circle move around as you showed, it would be cool to have the scoring part
// indicate the location of incorrect / correct answers in the XY field.
// Iâ€™m picturing almost like a heat map where one color indicates passes and another color indicates misses.
// If the big circle moves around and you have a bunch of trials, it should be able to spit out some dataâ€¦.
// That we could then download and track over time ðŸ˜Š Happy to talk in person if that was confusing.
// This is amazing though Ruben, thanks for taking the time to work on it.
